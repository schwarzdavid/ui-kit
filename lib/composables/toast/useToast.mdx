# useToast

<Story of={ToastOutlet.Default}/>

Toast util composable to functionally show toasts.

## General Usage

First, anywhere inside your application and inside the `VApp` Vuetify-component, place the `UiKitOutlet`. This component renders the later created dialogs. It is recommended to use the root component of your application for this (`App.vue`).

```vue
<template>
    <VApp>
        <VMain>
            ...
        </VMain>
        <UiKitOutlet/>    <-- This need to be INSIDE the VApp
    </VApp>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
    import {UiKitOutlet} from "@schwarzdavid/ui-kit";
</script>
```

After the UiKitOutlet is placed anywhere in your application, you can call one of the provided functions to create a predefined dialog in your individual components. See the documentation below.

## Success/Info/Warning/Error Toasts

The ToastComposable comes with four different presets.
